  proc macro for defining tables and named prepared statements
    tables represent the normalized app model
    prepared statements
      generate methods with given names
      generate incrementally-updated indexes
      prepared select statements
        really just materialized views with parameter placeholders
        generate model method for querying during updates
        generate rerenderer method
      prepared update/insert/delete statements
        generate model method for updating/inserting/deleting
    model is backed by revori-style persistent tree
      not directly exposed to app
  renderer
    ctor takes initial model
    app renders dom using e.g. typed-html macro, optionally using renderer to generate parts
    renderer methods (defined by select statements above)
      take function which takes query row result items as parameters and returns vector of dom node
      return vector of RCs to dom nodes produced by calling above function
      stores function and RCs to dom nodes internally for rerenders later
    app can define loop that updates the model and passes result to renderer
      renderer diffs old model with new model
      maps diff elements to any functions and RCs of dom nodes and rerenders
      todo: how do rerenders propagate to real dom?
